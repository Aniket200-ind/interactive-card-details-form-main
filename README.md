### What I learned

I learned how to use redux toolkit for state management in react. I also learned how to use tailwind css for styling. I also learned how to use react-router-dom for routing in react. I also learned how to use react-hook-form for form validation in react. I also learned how to use zod for making schema validation for form values.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on redux toolkit and tailwind css. I also want to learn more about react-router-dom and react-hook-form. I also want to learn more about zod. I also want to focus on validating a form.
